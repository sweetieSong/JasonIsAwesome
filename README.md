cs244b final project

Create a jar file for either the entry into Gossip or Dynamo. In runDynamo I called them Final.jar and FinalGossip.jar respectively.

runDynamo has configurable parameters for you to run the all the java process. It is given to loop for 100 processes, but feel free to add more.
Dyanmo takes in:
    receivePort numbers
    the milliseconds for each round
    k
    message drop
    
Gossip takes in the following inputs:
    receivePort number
    the milliseconds for each round
    f failure rounds
    message drop
    ORIGINAL or ROBIN for the original or binary round robin protocal

Finally use k.sh to kill all the processes.
